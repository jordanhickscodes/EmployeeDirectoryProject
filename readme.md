## Is there any other information youâ€™d like us to know?

- If you put breakpoints while running the app you will see activity indicators to represent the loading state. Also, in the fetch image request, instead of passing errors back to the view, I printed them to the console.  Since there is a placeholder image, I didn't feel the need to pass the errors into the UI.  I do have the console print out any errors acting as a form of logging to avoid silent failing.
